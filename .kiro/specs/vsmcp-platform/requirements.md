# Requirements Document

## Introduction

VSMCP (Viable System Model Context Protocol) is a distributed self-regulating coordination framework built on the Advanced Model Context Protocol (aMCP) - a novel advancement of the MCP protocol designed to enable fractally organized, event-driven, high-throughput, low-latency, context-aware communication between AI agents and messaging middleware systems. The system implements Stafford Beer's cybernetic principles through the Viable System Model (VSM), creating a capability-agnostic platform that orchestrates subsystems using real-time event streams, modular logic pipelines, and cryptographic validation mechanisms.

The architecture integrates context-supported messaging, zone-aware routing, fault and zombie detection, cryptographic nonce replay prevention, and AI-assisted policy generation mediated by Standard Operating Procedures in a human and machine-readable, auditable format. Built on Erlang/Elixir for high-availability distributed fault-tolerant clusters, Rust for low-latency computation and WASM compilation, and AMQP/MQTT/XMPP as the transport fabric, VSMCP provides a resilient foundation for decentralized automation, AI inference pipelines, and self-tuning policy enforcement.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want an aMCP-based capability-agnostic platform that can dynamically discover and integrate external agents at runtime, so that new capabilities can be added without modifying the core codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an external aMCP server announces its capabilities THEN the system SHALL discover and merge the announcement within 30 seconds using the contextual fusion engine
2. WHEN a new agent is announced THEN the system SHALL make it available for invocation without requiring code changes to the core platform
3. WHEN multiple VSMCP instances receive the same announcement THEN they SHALL converge to the same capability registry state using CRDT
4. IF an announcement signature is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the capability, log a security event, and trigger the immune system response
5. WHEN capabilities are discovered THEN they SHALL include structured metadata for semantic identity, origin, intent, and priority class

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the system through natural language and visual programming interfaces, so that I can access all capabilities consistently through chat, tasks, and notes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a natural language request THEN the system SHALL classify the intent using LLM integration and route it to the appropriate capability
2. WHEN a capability supports streaming responses THEN the system SHALL forward the stream to the user in real-time via the reactive stream engine
3. WHEN a capability invocation fails THEN the system SHALL return a meaningful error message and suggest alternative approaches
4. IF no capability matches the user's intent THEN the system SHALL attempt LLM-assisted planning to decompose the request into executable steps
5. WHEN users interact via the visual canvas THEN they SHALL be able to drag and drop to build pipelines without writing code
6. WHEN context is preserved THEN it SHALL be maintained across sessions using the contextual logic graph

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want zone-aware routing and cryptographic security with an AI-powered immune system, so that the platform can autonomously detect and respond to threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to invoke a capability THEN the system SHALL verify zone permissions and nonce validity before execution
2. IF a user lacks permission for a capability THEN the system SHALL deny access and return a policy violation message
3. WHEN zone policies are updated THEN the system SHALL apply the new policies without requiring restart using hot-patch capabilities
4. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them using reactive detection and generate mitigation policies via LLM
5. WHEN nonce reuse is detected THEN the system SHALL prevent replay attacks using Rust/WASM filters and Bloom verification
6. WHEN zombie nodes are identified THEN the system SHALL exclude them from routing and re-shard workloads to adjacent nodes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want recursive VSM spawning with fractal organization capabilities, so that the system can create autonomous subsystems that adapt and self-organize like a living organism.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a spawn_meta intent is invoked THEN the system SHALL create a new child VSM instance with its own Systems 1-5
2. WHEN a child VSM is created THEN it SHALL announce its own capabilities via aMCP like any external agent
3. IF recursion depth exceeds the configured limit THEN the system SHALL block the spawn and log a security event
4. WHEN a child VSM is spawned THEN the parent SHALL be able to invoke the child's capabilities through the contextual logic graph
5. WHEN subsystems are created THEN they SHALL implement the five VSM layers with appropriate feedback loops and adaptation mechanisms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an auditor, I want cryptographically signed snapshots and LLM-powered policy review, so that I can verify system state and receive AI-generated compliance assessments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a snapshot is requested THEN the system SHALL generate a signed CRDT snapshot of all capabilities with forward secrecy
2. WHEN a snapshot is created THEN the system SHALL log the SHA-256 hash for integrity verification
3. WHEN streaming a snapshot THEN the system SHALL include both the data and cryptographic signature
4. IF snapshot generation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and notify the requester
5. WHEN policy violations are detected THEN the LLM SHALL generate structured reports identifying discrepancies and suggesting SOP updates
6. WHEN audit events occur THEN they SHALL be categorized into predefined note types for human review

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive observability with event-driven pattern detection, so that I can understand system behavior and enable autonomous responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system event occurs THEN the system SHALL emit telemetry following consistent naming conventions via the GoldRush runtime
2. WHEN capabilities are invoked THEN the system SHALL track latency, success rates, and error patterns using merged query detection
3. WHEN system components interact THEN the system SHALL provide distributed tracing capabilities with causality chain tracking
4. WHEN metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be exposed via Prometheus-compatible endpoints and fed to the Central Aggregator
5. WHEN event patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL apply user-defined pattern matchers over live streams
6. WHEN complex scenarios are identified THEN the system SHALL generate structured reports for LLM-powered analysis

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want multiple communication interfaces with WASM-powered edge deployment, so that the system can operate across diverse environments from browser to backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact via Telegram THEN the system SHALL process messages and return responses in the chat with persistent context
2. WHEN users access the web interface THEN the system SHALL provide a Phoenix LiveView dashboard with visual mindmap canvas
3. WHEN external systems call HTTP APIs THEN the system SHALL respond according to OpenAPI specifications
4. WHEN systems communicate internally THEN they SHALL use AMQP/MQTT/XMPP transport fabric for reliability
5. WHEN edge deployment is needed THEN handlers SHALL be compiled to WASM for sandboxed execution in browsers or edge devices
6. WHEN policies are enforced THEN they SHALL be deployable as WASM modules for client-side validation without server round trips

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want infrastructure-as-code deployment with plugin extensibility, so that the system can be consistently deployed and extended across diverse environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to cloud environments THEN the system SHALL use Terraform configurations for resource provisioning
2. WHEN setting up bare-metal deployments THEN the system SHALL use Ansible playbooks for configuration
3. WHEN running in development THEN the system SHALL support Docker Compose for local services
4. WHEN infrastructure changes THEN deployments SHALL be reproducible and version-controlled
5. WHEN plugins are needed THEN the system SHALL support runtime registration of domain-specific event handlers, metric transformers, and behavior hooks
