# VSMCP Core Design Document

## Overview

The VSMCP (Viable System Model Context Protocol) implements Stafford Beer's cybernetic management principles through a distributed self-regulating coordination framework built on the Advanced Model Context Protocol (aMCP). The system provides the foundational Systems 1-5 of the VSM while enabling fractally organized, event-driven, high-throughput, low-latency, context-aware communication between AI agents and messaging middleware systems.

Built on Erlang/Elixir for high-availability distributed fault-tolerant clusters, Rust for low-latency computation and WASM compilation, and AMQP/MQTT/XMPP as the transport fabric, VSMCP orchestrates subsystems using real-time event streams, modular logic pipelines, and cryptographic validation mechanisms. The architecture integrates context-supported messaging, zone-aware routing, fault and zombie detection, cryptographic nonce replay prevention, and AI-assisted policy generation.

The system follows a monolithic Phoenix application approach (as documented in ADR-001) to maximize cohesion between the five VSM systems while maintaining clear separation of concerns. All capabilities are acquired at runtime through signed aMCP announcements, creating a truly dynamic and extensible platform with semantic durability and contextual fusion capabilities.

### VSM Systems Mapping

The five systems of the Viable System Model are implemented with cybernetic principles as follows:

- **System 1 (Operations)**: aMCP-backed task agents that execute commands, handle I/O, intent dispatch, tool execution, and sub-VSM delegation with fractal organization

- **System 2 (Coordination)**: Zone-aware sharding, plugin scheduling, coordination between operational units, rate limiting, resource allocation, and zombie node detection

- **System 3 (Control/Audit)**: Policy agents, cybernetic notes, internal control, monitoring, audit capabilities, and the Central Aggregator for event pattern analysis

- **System 4 (Intelligence)**: LLM reasoning modules for environmental scanning, capability discovery, strategic planning, policy review engine, and contextual fusion

- **System 5 (Policy)**: User prompt interface, cybernetic configuration, governance policies, zone-based access control, recursion limits, and immune system responses

Each system implements recursive feedback loops and adaptation mechanisms, enabling continuous adaptability where every prompt or agent launch is checked against live feedback from lower layers.

## Advanced Model Context Protocol (aMCP) Architecture

### aMCP Layered Protocol Design

The Advanced Model Context Protocol (aMCP) serves as the cognitive substrate of VSMCP's architecture, addressing the shortcomings of traditional message passing frameworks by embedding context, control flow, and policy enforcement into the protocol layer itself.

#### Transport Layer (AMQP/MQTT/XMPP Compatible)

- Acts as the underlying conveyor belt for messages between nodes and agents

- Messages may be broadcast, fanout, or unicast with topic routing, durability flags, and delivery confirmations

- Ensures messages are verifiably delivered and processed, decoupling producers from consumers

- Supports multiple transport protocols for diverse deployment scenarios

#### Context Layer (Semantic Fusion)

- Each message includes structured metadata for semantic identity, origin, intent, and priority class

- Context is preserved across sessions and used to track causality chains, enforce access policies, and feed inference memory

- Enables agents to reason about the narrative of message flows, not just the payloads

- Constructs a contextual logic graph across time, event chains, and message relationships

#### Reactive Stream Engine (GoldRush Runtime)

- Erlang/Elixir-based event processor capable of applying user-defined pattern matchers over live streams

- Broadcasting structured event contexts to subscribers with real-time processing

- Triggering workflows or policies from matching events declaratively

- Provides the streaming substrate for contextual reactions with immediate response capabilities

#### Security Layer (Nonce + Bloom Verification)

- All aMCP messages are cryptographically signed and include nonces to prevent replay attacks

- Detect duplicated or tampered packets with forward secrecy across hops

- Verification performed using Rust-compiled WebAssembly modules for ultra-low latency validation

- Bloom filters store recent nonces for rapid membership checking without heavy memory cost

#### Plugin Layer (Custom Extensions)

- Pluggable architecture where developers can register domain-specific event handlers

- Metric transformers and behavior hooks tied to AMQP headers, payload shape, or stream labels

- Runtime extensibility for any vertical (DeFi, logistics, healthcare) to build custom context evaluators

- Support for Log Analyzer, IoT Processor, and Job Queue plugins

### Contextual Logic Graph and Semantic Durability

The unique innovation in aMCP is its contextual fusion engine that constructs a graph of meaning across time, event chains, and message relationships. This graph enables:

- Dynamic compute allocation based on priority and urgency

- Selection of relevant subgraphs for context-aware prompting

- Generation of self-tuning policy agents based on observed behavior

- Semantic durability where messages preserve their meaning and execution context across time

Each node in the graph is a living, mutable structure tied to CRDTs, meaning multiple agents across different machines can update context concurrently with no race conditions and no central state required.

### LLM Integration and Stream-Driven Prompting

aMCP integrates directly with Large Language Models to enable:

- Conversion of telemetry into summarized intent ("latency spike due to disk saturation")

- Transformation of queries into system commands ("spin up another GPU runner")

- Explanation of anomalies using event provenance and causal evidence

- Stream-driven prompting where events are embedded into LLM context windows in real-time

### WebAssembly Runtime and Edge Deployment

Every handler or plugin in the aMCP pipeline can be compiled to WASM for execution in a sandboxed environment:

- Prevents malicious code execution with consistent runtime behavior across devices

- Enables push-to-browser or push-to-edge deployment models

- Policy violations auto-generate reactive WASM modules deployed directly to user interfaces

- Enforces safeguards like DOM blocking, form validation, and live alerts

- **Intent Classification Failures**: Fallback to LLM-assisted classification

- **Capability Not Found**: Suggest similar capabilities or trigger discovery

- **Permission Denied**: Clear policy violation messages with guidance

- **Tool Execution Failures**: Retry logic with alternative tool suggestions

### Error Recovery Patterns

#### Circuit Breaker Implementation

```elixir

defmodule VSMCP.CircuitBreaker do

  @moduledoc "Circuit breaker for external capability calls"

  def call(capability_name, fun) do

    case get_state(capability_name) do

      :closed -> execute_with_monitoring(capability_name, fun)

      :open -> {:error, :circuit_open}

      :half_open -> try_recovery(capability_name, fun)

    end

  end

end

```

#### Graceful Degradation

- Capability unavailable → Suggest alternatives or queue for later

- LLM service down → Use cached intent classifications

- Database unavailable → Use in-memory state with eventual consistency

- Message bus down → Direct HTTP fallback for critical operations

## Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid Structure

#### Unit Tests (70%)

- **Pure Function Testing**: All business logic functions with property-based testing

- **Behaviour Testing**: Mock external dependencies using Mox library

- **CRDT Property Tests**: Convergence and commutativity verification

- **Policy Engine Tests**: Comprehensive rule evaluation scenarios

#### Integration Tests (20%)

- **MCP Protocol Integration**: End-to-end capability discovery and invocation

- **Database Integration**: CRUD operations and transaction handling

- **Message Bus Integration**: AMQP message flow and error scenarios

- **External Service Integration**: Telegram, LLM, and monitoring services

#### System Tests (10%)

- **Full System Scenarios**: Complete user journeys from intent to response

- **Chaos Engineering**: Network partitions, service failures, and recovery

- **Performance Testing**: Load testing with realistic capability invocation patterns

- **Security Testing**: Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment

### Test Implementation Examples

#### Property-Based CRDT Testing

```elixir

defmodule VSMCP.CRDTPropertyTest do

  use ExUnitProperties

  property "CRDT convergence under network partitions" do

    check all operations <- list_of(crdt_operation()),

              partition_scenario <- partition_scenario() do

      # Apply operations under partition

      {state1, state2} = apply_with_partition(operations, partition_scenario)

      # Heal partition and merge

      merged_state = CRDT.merge(state1, state2)

      # Verify convergence properties

      assert CRDT.consistent?(merged_state)

      assert contains_all_operations?(merged_state, operations)

    end

  end

end

```

#### Chaos Testing Scenarios

```elixir

defmodule VSMCP.ChaosTest do

  @moduledoc "Chaos engineering tests for system resilience"

  test "system recovers from 30% packet loss" do

    # Start system with full capability set

    initial_capabilities = start_system_with_capabilities(100)

    # Introduce network chaos

    :chaos.introduce_packet_loss(0.3)

    # Wait for partition healing

    :timer.sleep(60_000)

    # Verify recovery

    recovered_capabilities = get_available_capabilities()

    recovery_rate = length(recovered_capabilities) / length(initial_capabilities)

    assert recovery_rate >= 0.95

  end

end

```
