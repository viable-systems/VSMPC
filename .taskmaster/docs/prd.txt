# VSMCP Platform - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

VSMCP (Viable System Model Context Protocol) is a distributed self-regulating coordination framework built on the Advanced Model Context Protocol (aMCP). The system implements Stafford Beer's cybernetic principles through the Viable System Model (VSM), creating a capability-agnostic platform that orchestrates subsystems using real-time event streams, modular logic pipelines, and cryptographic validation mechanisms.

## Product Vision

Create a revolutionary distributed cybernetic platform that enables fractally organized, event-driven, high-throughput, low-latency, context-aware communication between AI agents and messaging middleware systems. The platform will serve as a resilient foundation for decentralized automation, AI inference pipelines, and self-tuning policy enforcement.
